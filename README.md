# Wide-field-Nfacet
Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate two wide field imaging algorithms: N-Faceting and the improved W-stacking

## Contact

If you cannot get in touch with me (very likely due to my work placement), consider contacting Steve Gull and Sze M Tan (szemengtan@gmail.com). 

## Publication

Description of the algorithms can be found in my thesis (https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.39448). The paper is on the way.

## Declaration: 

Please consult for reference. 

Due to my upcomming work replacement, I cannot update this repo as I wish, but there are certainly many things to check and update. Please report any mistakes or suggest improvements. Thank you!
